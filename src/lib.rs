//! # NSGI: Native Web Server Gateway Interface
//!
//! This crate provides the C ABI types and function pointer signature that form the NSGI protocol.
//! It is `#![no_std]` and has zero dependencies.
//!
//! NSGI is a language-agnostic gateway interface protocol that connects any C ABI host with
//! application logic written in any language supporting FFI.
//!
//! ## NSGI String Data Convention
//!
//! **All** text and data fields in this protocol are represented as a pair:
//! a raw byte pointer (`*const u8`) and a length (`usize`). They are **NOT** null-terminated.
//! Both the host and the application **must** rely entirely on the companion `_len` field to
//! determine the extent of the data; never pass these pointers to functions that expect C strings.
//!
//! ## Field Validity
//!
//! Every text field is free of the bytes that delimit an HTTP/1.1 message: no NUL, LF or CR at
//! any position, and no leading or trailing SP or HTAB. A host rejects a request carrying them,
//! with 400 unless a more suitable status applies. An application does not return them either,
//! and a host answers 500 rather than transmitting them. Bodies carry data rather than text and
//! are not covered.
//!
//! The rule covers bytes as received. Percent-encoding is legal throughout a request target, so
//! `/a%0Db` is valid here and decodes to a path holding CR; a host does not decode, and it is
//! the response side that keeps a decoded delimiter off the wire.
